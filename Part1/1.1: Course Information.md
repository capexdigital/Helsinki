Let's start by making a simple React application as well as getting to know the core concepts of React.

The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called Vite.

Let's create an application called introdemo, navigate to its directory and install the libraries:

# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest introdemo --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest introdemo -- --template react

# then run..
cd introdemo
npm install

# Start Application with..
npm run dev

**I am running Linux Mint which is based on Ubuntu, so you can easily use nvm to upgrade Node.js**

# recommend 20+
nvm install 20

# then run..
nvm use 20

# You can also make it the default so you donâ€™t have to run nvm use 20 every time
nvm alias default 20
